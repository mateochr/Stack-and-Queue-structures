# Stack-and-Queue-structures

There are two interfaces, `StringStack.java` and `IntQueue.java` which define basic methods for a stack (LIFO) and a queue (FIFO), with data of type `String` and `int` respectivly. Both implementations were made with a singly linked list and all actions of inserting or removing require O(1) complexity. If the stack or the queue is empty the functions that read from the structure throw exception of type `NoSuchElementException`. `ListNode.java` is common for both projects.
